# Product-Recommendation-System
A data science project where I built a recommendation engine using SQL only , no machine learning and based on real-world retail transaction data.

# Project overview

This project explores the purchasing trends/patterns from a UK-based online retailer and uses SQL queries to :

-> analyze product popularity

-> identifying top customers and products purchased 

-> build a recommendation query which suggests frequently bought together products

# Tech Stack

-> Excel (initial/raw  data)

-> SQL (cleaning and queries)

# Data Cleaning (Using SQL)
Removed rows with NULL values in CustomerID or Description

Excluded records with Quantity <= 0 (indicating returns or cancellations)

Converted original Excel file to CSV and imported into SQL

# Key Insights of the project

-> Top selling products

-> High value customers/revenue generators

-> Frequently bought together

# Conclusion

This project shows how far SQL alone can go in real-world data analysis. 
With nothing more than joins, filters, and aggregations, we built a fully functional, data-driven recommendation system.
